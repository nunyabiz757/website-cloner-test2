# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide - Full Playwright Support!

## ✅ What's Been Configured

Your Website Cloner Pro is now ready for Railway deployment with **FULL Playwright** support (no workarounds needed)!

### Files Created:

1. **`Dockerfile`** - Optimized for Railway with Playwright
   - Installs all Chromium dependencies
   - Installs Playwright browsers during build
   - Configured for Node.js 20

2. **`railway.json`** - Railway-specific configuration
   - Uses Dockerfile for deployment
   - Configures health checks
   - Sets restart policies

3. **`api/capture.ts`** - FULL Playwright implementation
   - Uses `playwright` (not compressed version!)
   - 5-minute timeout (vs 10-second on Vercel)
   - Scrolls pages for lazy loading
   - Extracts runtime CSS

4. **`package.json`** - Restored full Playwright
   - No workarounds, no limitations

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Railway

1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. Add these environment variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://rontqbmunyluuknkalsw.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

**Important:** Use your actual Supabase keys!

---

### Step 2: Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment with full Playwright support"
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 3: Create New Project on Railway

1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Choose your repository: **website-cloner-test2**
5. Railway will automatically:
   - Detect the Dockerfile
   - Build your app
   - Install Playwright + Chromium
   - Deploy your app

---

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

**Build Logs to Watch For:**

```
✓ Installing dependencies...
✓ Running: npm ci --only=production
✓ Installing Playwright browsers...
✓ npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
✓ Downloading Chromium 141.0.7390.37
✓ Chromium installed successfully
✓ Building application...
✓ npm run build
✓ Build completed
✓ Starting application...
✓ Deployment successful!
```

**Expected Build Time:** 5-10 minutes (first time)
- Installing Chromium takes time
- Subsequent deployments are faster (cached)

---

### Step 5: Get Your Railway URL

After deployment completes:

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on **"Settings"**
3. Find **"Domains"** section
4. You'll see a URL like: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

Copy this URL - this is your live app!

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

### Test 1: Verify App is Live

Open your Railway URL in a browser:
```
https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
```

You should see your Website Cloner Pro homepage!

---

### Test 2: Test Browser Automation (React App)

1. Go to Clone page
2. **Enable "Browser Automation" toggle** ✅
3. Enter: `https://react.dev`
4. Click "Start Cloning"

**Expected Results:**
```
✅ Browser service ready
✅ Requesting browser capture via Vercel API
✅ Navigating to https://react.dev...
✅ Page captured successfully
✅ HTML length: 150,000+ chars
✅ Components detected: 40+
```

**This should take 10-30 seconds** (no timeout errors!)

---

### Test 3: Test Complex SPA

Try cloning: `https://tailwindcss.com`

**Expected:**
- ✅ Full JavaScript execution
- ✅ All sections captured
- ✅ Dynamic content rendered
- ✅ 50+ components detected
- ✅ No timeout errors

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Build Fails - "Playwright install failed"

**Check build logs for:**
```
Error: Failed to download Chromium
```

**Solution:**
1. Railway dashboard → Settings → Environment
2. Add: `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=0`
3. Redeploy

---

### Issue 2: App Crashes - "Memory limit exceeded"

**Check logs for:**
```
JavaScript heap out of memory
```

**Solution:**
1. Railway dashboard → Settings → Resources
2. Increase memory allocation to 2GB
3. This will increase cost slightly (~$2-3/month more)

---

### Issue 3: API Endpoint Returns 404

**Check:**
1. Railway dashboard → Logs
2. Look for: `Cannot GET /api/capture`

**Solution:**
Railway might need explicit API routing. Update Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Change CMD line to:
CMD ["npm", "run", "preview", "--", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "$PORT"]
```

---

### Issue 4: Deployment Takes Too Long (> 15 minutes)

**Normal for first deployment:**
- Installing Chromium takes 5-7 minutes
- Building Node modules takes 3-5 minutes

**If consistently slow:**
- Check Railway status page
- Try redeploying (build cache helps)

---

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

❌ Shows "Loading..." div
❌ 0 components detected
❌ Build failed with Playwright errors
```

### After (Railway):
```
Clone React App:
✅ Full JavaScript-rendered content
✅ All components visible
✅ 40+ components detected
✅ Runtime styles captured
✅ No errors, no timeouts
```

## 🎓 Learning Points

**What You've Learned:**

1. **Serverless vs Containers**
   - Vercel: Serverless functions (limited)
   - Railway: Full containers (unlimited)

2. **Deployment Strategies**
   - Vercel: Zero-config (easy but limited)
   - Railway: Docker-based (flexible, powerful)

3. **Cost Trade-offs**
   - Free (Vercel): $0 but limited
   - Railway: $5-10/mo for full power
   - Best value for your use case!
